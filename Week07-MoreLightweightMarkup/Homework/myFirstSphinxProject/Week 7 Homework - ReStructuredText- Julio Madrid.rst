Julio Madrid's ReStructuredText Homework
========================================

This is my first experience with reStructured text!

What is reStructuredText?
--------------------------

**reStructuredText** is plain text markup syntax and parser system. Below is an example of reStructuredText written in the Online Sphinx editor: 

I use white space between lines of text to create paragraphs.

I use an asterisk in the Online Sphinx editor to create an unordered list.

* Here is a bullet point created with an asterisk.
- Here is another bullet point created with a dash; asterisks and dashes are interchangeable in the editor.

If I wanted to include an inspirational quote, I would use indentation to separate it from "normal" text:
              
 *"Water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend." - Bruce Lee*

How is reStructuredText Useful?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
restructuredText is useful for in-line documentation, for quickly creating simple webpages, and for standalone documents. 

**Primary Objective**

  to define and implement a markup syntax for use in Python docstrings that is accessible and yet powerful enough for non-trivial use.
